# Weather Forecast App

## Features Requirements:
 * Using any weather APi, request the weather from any location;
 * Create an UI that can show next weather's from this location;
 * Since weather doesn't change frequently we don't need to request all the time, this way we can save mobile data. So create a cache to solve this issue;
 * App must work in landscape and portrait orientation;

## Architecture Requirements:
 * Develop in Kotlin;
 * Use MVVM as architecture;
 * Use Retrofit to request from API and cache;
 * Use LiveData to keep the app lifecycle aware;

## Guide:
 * You may want to use https://openweathermap.org/api.
 * Retrofit: https://square.github.io/retrofit.
